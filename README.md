# Faraday-effect-simulator
Python code to simulate Faraday's effect: the rotation of polarization of a wavepacket in the presence of an external magnetic field.
Notebook with the derivation of the equations used for the Maxwell solver, the current density term, the wavepacket source and the boundary conditions implemented. See report for more details on the derivations and the results we obtained.
